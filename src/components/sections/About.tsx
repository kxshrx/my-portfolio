                I&apos;m a Computer Science student from Chennai who enjoys building
                practical tech. Most of what I&apos;ve worked on so far comes from
                experimenting ‚Äî trying out things in machine learning, web
                development, and IoT, and learning as I go.
              </p>

              <p className="text-sm">
                Lately, I&apos;ve been focusing more on AI and how to skill myself
                properly in that space. There&apos;s a lot happening, and I&apos;m
                just trying to keep up, learn the right tools, and use them for
                meaningful things ‚Äî not just chasing hype but trying to build stuff
                that actually works.
              </p>

              <p className="text-sm">
                Outside of projects, I spend a lot of time watching tech videos,
                following new launches, or just exploring how things work. I also
                enjoy quiet time outdoors ‚Äî it helps clear my head and reset.

              <p className="text-sm">
                This portfolio is just a place to put my work out there. I&apos;m
                still figuring things out, but open to feedback, learning, and
                connecting with people on the same path.
